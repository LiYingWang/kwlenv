# Introduction
<!-- introduction about European expansion -->
European expansion since the 15th century was usually associated with long-distance trade, exploration, and colonization in many parts of the world, which often led to profound impacts on indigenous societies. Depending on particular geographic and historical circumstances, many regions experienced different forms of European colonialism and power relations [@Jordan2009]. Understanding the dynamics of these colonial processes has become a significant issue in archaeology because it provides critical insights into the complex outcomes of European colonization [@Gosden2004]. In Asia, European colonization was mainly motivated by the acquisition of raw materials, natural resources, or luxury items from Asia for commercial purposes [@Prakash1997]. Although the new exchange systems or colonial institutions introduced by Europeans could change local economic systems, social structures, and settlement patterns [@Christie1996; @Junker2004; @Lape2002], indigenous groups did not just accept European colonization passively. Recent discussions on colonial interactions also suggest the active role of indigenous groups in responding to the arrival of Europeans and presenting resistance, negotiation, persistence, resilience, and entanglement [@Torrence2003; @Silliman2005; @Mitchell2010; @Jordan2009; @Alexander1998; @Noe2023]. 

<!-- NE Taiwan as a case study -->
While many studies focus on prominent colonies, places on the periphery of colonial centers were also more and less impacted by European powers or associated trading systems [@Acabado2017; @Trabert2017]. Exploring these areas is important to gain a broader understanding of the varied consequences of colonial expansion. Yilan, located in northeastern Taiwan, is an example of a periphery region where European control was limited and indirect for most of the time but intensively involved in regional trade activities stimulated by the European presence. In the mid-17th century, the VOC (Dutch East India Company) formalized the deerskin trade in Taiwan for export on a large scale, involving many Indigenous communities and Han Chinese settlers [@Heyns2001; @Cheng2017]. Despite some discussions on the operations and policies of the deerskin trade, direct investigations on archaeological evidence into the experiences of local indigenous people with the commercial activities are rare. The European impacts on local ecological conditions have been recorded in many places in colonial settings [@Jordan2009]. Whether the interaction between Indigenous people and their environment changed due to European trade demands requires further archaeological investigation.

<!-- research aim and questions -->
In this paper, I will explore the interactions between people and their environment in a colonial context by examining the resource use of indigenous people through a case study at the Kiwulan site (1350-1950 CE), the largest Iron Age settlement in northeastern Taiwan [@Chen2007]. Kiwulan encountered European presence in the 17th century, followed by a large influx of Han Chinese migration in the 19th century. What was the resource use of Indigenous people before and after the foreign presence? Can we identify shifts in these practices in response to colonial economic demands? To address these questions, I will focus on subsistence practices because the choices made in daily practices can reveal the strategies Indigenous people used to respond to resource explortations by foreign presence. I will examine the zooarchaeological assemblages from the upper culture layer at Kiwulan, a large settlement dating to 14-19th centuries. Zooarchaeology can offer insights into how animals were utilized in response to economic strategies within certain social contexts, such as European colonization or intercultural contact [@Defrance2009]. Through a zooarchaeological perspective, this study aims to shed light on Indigenous persistence and resilience strategies in the face of foreign interruptions.

# European Encounters in the Northern Taiwan
<!-- Spanish colonization and the power relations in particular spatial and temporal contexts-->
In 1626, the Spanish East Indies Company (Indias Orientales Espa√±olas) arrived in northern Taiwan and established the San Salvador colony at Heping Dao in Keelung, followed by Santo Domingo in Tamsui, to counter the threat of the VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie; Dutch East India Company) in the Asian market, which had established a colony in southern Taiwan two years earlier [@Borao2009, p.41; @Andrade2007]. Although the Spanish intended to build a colonial city, San Salvador remains its early development during their colonization, primarily consisting of a fortress and a church [@Borao2009, pp. 103-134; @Berrocal2018]. The neighboring area of the fort was inhavited by local indigenous groups, the Taparris and the Quimaurris, who had lived at the location of the fort before being expelled by the Spanish [@Borao2001, SIT:165, p.81]. The relations between the Spanish and indigenous people might not involve extensive colonialism or intercultural domination, and the Spanish territorial control could be limited to the fort. Instead, the Spanish relied on the exchange of local goods and food surpluses with local indigenous people, according to written records [@Borao2001, SIT:170-171]. This corresponds with a higher proportion of indigenous and Chinese items with little European material found in San Salvador [@Berrocal2018], indicating cultural entanglement. 

<!-- the Dutch domination, how and why colonial powers were able to exert control -->
In 1642, the Dutch defeated the Spanish and took over San Salvador and Santo Domingo, expanding their colonial power to northern and eastern Taiwan until 1662. Compared to the Spanish, the Dutch were more strategic in consolidating their power by forming alliances with indigenous villages, implementing political and economic institutions, and conquering villages that were unwilling to comply [@Kang2016; @Andrade2007]. For example, the VOC governors used various colonial institutions to secure their authority, including the annual landdag gathering, taxation, tribute system, village lease system, census investigations, and the selection of indigenous representatives [@Kang2016; @Andrade1997; @Andrade2007]. Among the political institutions, the tribute system operated from 1642 to 1647 and the village lease system introduced in 1644 had great impacts on the local indigenous economy and environment. Based on the tribute system, each household in allied villages was required to pay rice or high-quality deerskin annually. The amount of deerskins collected from indigenous people in northern Taiwan once reached 7,000 pieces in 1646 [@Andrade2007]. Moreover, to increase deerskin exports to Japan, the Dutch implemented a hunting license system (1636-1645) that gave Han Chinese permission to hunt deer on indigenous lands during certain periods [@Heyns2001]. From 1633 to 1661, the average number of deerskins exported from Taiwan was about 67,000 per year [@Koo2011; @Cheng2017]. Those colonial activities accelerated the decline in the deer population and could lead to a harsh situation for the indigenous economy.

<!--variation of colonial powers across regions and indirect colonization at Kavalan-->
Although the Dutch power expanded across nearly all of Taiwan in the middle of the 17th century, the extent of their colonial dominance and control differed greatly among different regions. Colonial rules in regions far from the European forts were usually difficult and unsuccessful. Yilan in northeastern Taiwan is an example of minimal European presence and indirect colonization, with fewer imposed colonial rules for most of the time [@Kang2012]. Yilan is an alluvial plain, located about 70 kilometers from the European colony in Keelung, with mountains in between. The main inhabitants in Yilan were the local indigenous group, the Kavalan. Given its strategic location on the route to Torrobouan, where the Dutch believed gold mines existed, they were eager to bring this area under their control [@DZI2000; @Kang2016, p47]. In 1644, the Dutch invaded Yilan to incorporate the defeated Kavalan villages into their northern colonial territory and demanded tribute from the indigenous people [@Kang2016]. Instead of engaging directly with the Kavalan people, the Europeans relied heavily on the assistance of the Basay people active in northern Taiwan to coordinate and collect tributes in Yilan [@Kang2016]. This indirect approach allowed the maintenance of autonomy and flexibility for the Kavalan people, who were able to negotiate tribute requested by the VOC [@Kang2016]. 

<!-- the pre-existing trade network in norhtern Taiwan-->
Before the arrival of the Europeans in northern Taiwan, an inter-insular trade network had been established since the early 15th century, involving Chinese merchants and indigenous groups in Tamsui and Keelung [@Chen2005]. Chinese traders transported goods such as textiles, porcelains, beads, and metal items to exchange for raw materials from Taiwan, such as gold, sulfur, and animal hides and meats from the local Basay people [@Chen2005; @Andrade2007]. This regional trade network was further connected to maritime trade between Ming China and the Ryukyu Kingdom during the 15th and 16th centuries and later to European long-distance trade in the 17th century [@Chen2005; @Von2019; @Wang2007].Yilan was included in this long-established trade network, where the Kavalan people exchanged products such as rice and deerskins for foreign goods and handicrafts from the Basay people [@Kang2003]. This is evidenced by the large amount of imported foreign goods found across archaeological sites in Yilan, indicating frequent trade activities, especially around the 17th century [@TaiwanHistory2005]. Yilan experienced frequent trading activities driven by the pursuit of foreign goods even before the Europeans arrival, and these activities continued during the European presence in northern Taiwan, likely with some occasional pressure from European powers. This unique historical and spatial context makes Yilan an ideal location to study indigenous reactions to foreign influences and the associated trade networks from a long-term perspective in a pericolonial context [@Acabado2017; @Kang2016, pp. 31-78; @Trabert2017].

# Archaeological Context at Kiwulan
<!--introduction of Kiwulan and the population-->
Kiwulan, located in the northern part of Yilan, is a multi-component site, where the upper component spans from the late Iron Age to the historical periods (AD 1350-1850) [@Chen2007]. As a salvage project, a large scale excavation was conducted at Kiwulan to recover information before it was destroyed. A total of 262 excavation units uncovered abundant artifacts and features, including middens, burials, and post-holes with wooden posts in situ. It suggests that Kiwulan is a well-developed settlement with longhouses (approximately 40 x 80 m) situated side by side and burials located to the north of the residential area [@Chen2004]. The main inhabitants of Kiwulan were the Kavalan people, as indicated by local oral history and the similarities between Kavalan material culture recorded in historical records and archaeological artifacts [@Chen2004]. According to a mid-17th-century Dutch census, there were about 40 indigenous villages with approximately 10,000 people, and Kiwulan (referred to as Kibannoran in Dutch records) was the largest village, with 160 households and 711 people [@Nakamura1938]. In the early 19th century, the population of Kiwulan dramatically decreased to fewer than 100 people due to the population pressure of Han Chinese migrants, which led to the relocation of Kavalan people to eastern Taiwan [@Zhan1995]. 

<!--archaeological materials-->
The most common artifact was locally made pottery with geometric patterns as surface treatments, which was also found at many simultaneous sites in Yilan [@TaiwanHistory2005]. In addition to pottery, a variety of foreign goods, such as porcelains, stonewares, glass beads, carnelian beads, and metal artifacts, were largely found in both the residential area and burials. Due to no evidence of local production of beads or metallurgy, these items are believed to have been acquired through exchange, primarily with the Basay people active in northern Taiwan. This indicates that Kiwulan has continuously participated in regional trade networks closely associated with northern Taiwan since the 15th century and influenced by the long-distance trade during the 17th century [@Wang2007]. Moreover, the use of foreign goods appears to have cultural significance, and previous studies suggested a possible increase in social differentiation due to the introduction of foreign goods [@Wang2020ornament; @Wang2021].

<!--archaeological remains-->
There were a wide range of animal bones and plant remains uncovered, reflecting the diversity of the local diet and the environment close to river and coastal area. The animals include deer, pigs, cows, birds, fish, shellfish, and plants mainly consisting of rice, peach, pandanus, and cucurbits [@Chen2004]. Rice farming seems to be common but limited to a household scale, according to historical records [@]. Shellfish consist of bivalves such as clams and oysters and univalves from rivers and brackish water environments, which indicates a reliance on aquatic and marine resources. Those archaeological remains correspond with tools related to subsistence found at Kiwulan, including iron arrowheads for hunting, iron sickles for crop harvesting, and wooden paddles for water-related activities. According to those pieces of evidence, the subsistence practices at Kiwulan should be primarily reliant on rice farming, supplemented by hunting and fishing for wild resources. The resource use during the periods of external impacts still need further examination to better understands the changes over time. 

# Materials and Methods
To explore changes in dietary practices before and after the European arrival with associated long-distance trade, I examined faunal assemblages from 40 adjacent units at the residential area excavated during the first season (2001-2003) at Kiwulan [@Chen2007]. The remains considered in this study are from dwelling spaces and trash pits that could reflect daily dietary practices, whereas those from burials that might relate to ritual activities are excluded. These 40 units were selected because of their location that were believed to be the center of the settlement with thick archaeological deposits and relatively intact archaeological contexts. Also, the spatial continuity can provides a more consistent framework for understanding food practices over time on a settlement scale. The same excavation and recovery methods applied at the site allow comparison between assemblages from different temporal sequences. 

To construct a reliable fine-grained chronological sequence, archaeological deposits were divided into six cultural layers (CL6-CL1) spanning from the 14th century to the 19th century based on excavation depth, stratigraphic sections, sediment color and texture, radiocarbon dates, and archaeological diagnostic materials that served as time indicators. These diagnostic materials include stoneware commonly found at European associated sites in early 17th-century Southeast Asia, such as Anping jars and martavan [@Sakai2012; @Ketel2011; @Dizon2016; @Hsieh1995; @Lee2021], pipes, and Chinese bricks [@Wang2011; @Hsieh2009]. Although precisely identifying the stratum representing the European arrival is challenging due to its short duration, the separation of strata into six layers based on the criteria mentioned above could offer a relatively robust framework for comparing archaeological records before and after the European influence. Among these six temporal layers, the fourth layer can be associated with the 17th century, when the Europeans occupied northern Taiwan, while the second layer corresponds to the 19th century, associated with the large influx of Chinese migrants in Yilan.

Only the faunal assemblages identified to at least the family level were considered in this study for consistent comparison across time sequences. Deer antlers without attaching to crania were excluded since they were less likely related to dietary practices. To obtain generalized pattern of resource use, measures of ubiquity and taxonomic abundance were applied. Ubiquity measures the frequency of specific taxa through their presence or absence in particular depositional contexts, suggesting the regularity of animal consumption [@Mckechnie2016; @Vanderwarker2010]. Here ubiquity values are expressed as the percentage of units with a given taxon to the total number of units per cultural layers. Faunal assemblages were primarily quantified using the Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) method, with the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) applied when necessary, such as for estimating the expected NISP at a site [@Grayson2004; @Lyman2012]. Different from the minimum number of individuals (MNI) that determines the actual numbers of animals recovered from remains, NISP offers a broad overview of dietary practices by considering all fragmented bone assemblages. Despite the criticism of overestimation the number of animals, NISP captures better variation in species abundance on a site with less impacts from sample size [@Grayson1984; @Lyman2008]. For comparison of identified taxa across classes, the normalized NISP were used to avoid potential biases in identification due to differences in the preservation or recovery of skeletal elements [@Grayson2004]. The normalized NISP is calculated by dividing NISP by the number of skeletal elements. 

Given that deerskin was a primary commodity in local regional exchange since the 14th century and was in high demand during the Dutch colonization period [@Cheng2017], the frequencies of skeletal parts and surface modifications of deer bones were examined to assess butchery and transport strategies. This can shed light on how indigenous people utilize deer in response to high economic demand when involved in regional trade network. Skeletal parts were quantified using NISP and classified into groups based on meat yield and portions: meaty (e.g., upperlimb), mid-meaty (e.g., vertebrae), and less meaty parts (e.g., skull and lower limb) [@Madrigal2004; @Munro2004]. Teeth without associated cranial elements were excluded here to reduce overrepresentation due to their higher preservation and quantities compared to other parts. While lower limbs and skull bones have minimal meat, they are often valued in many cultures for marrow and soft tissues, such as tongue and brain [@Madrigal2002]. Thus, less meaty elements were considered as secondary source of nutrition in the interpretation. Similarly, the degree of fragmentation could also imply the extraction of marrow or grease, which is calculated by dividing the Minimal Number of Elements (MNE) by NISP. Bone surface modifications relative to human butchering and cooking activities, such as cut marks, fracturing, and burning damage, were recorded, as well as natural marks such as weathering and root etching for understanding taphonomic effects. Cut marks on major limb joints, such as shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle [@Lyman2005], were further quantified to explore any changes in butchering patterns between temporal sequences. Moreover, cut marks on lower limbs relative to skinning processes were examined and compared. Those marks are charactersitic of circular and straight incisions left by the series of cuts for acquiring intact animal hides [@Costamagno2019; @Isaakidou2007].

The faunal assemblage analyszed in this paper from Kiwulan is composed of `r total_NISP` bone fragments based on NISP, which increased over time from CL6, peaked at CL4, and then declined dramatically after CL4 (@fig-NISP-proportion: A). A similar trend was also observed in the weight of unidentified small bone fragments (@fig-NISP-proportion: B). Among the faunal remains, the deer family is the majority accounting for about `r deer_fami_NISP_per`% of the bones identified to class level, followed by boar and cattle as the second and third taxon (@tbl-counts). Within the deer family, sika deer is prevalent, with a few bones identified as muntjac and a specimen indicating a possible affiliation with sambar deer. Although sika deer was the major animal source at the site, variations in their quantities and proportions could be observed between temperoal sequences across 600 years. To further compare general patterns of dietary practices in terms of their economic values over time, the deer family were separated into two categories based on body size, deer (sika deer, sambar deer, and large deer) and muntjac, while water buffalo and yellow cattle were combined into one category, cattle. Rats (Rattus sp.) were excluded from further analyses as they are normally considered commensal animals, and their relatively intact skeletons from one single archaeological context show no direct evidence of being part of the daily diet.

For animal classes, the relative abundance shows that mammals are the primary dietary source throughout all layers, with fish as the secondary source in CL4 and birds in CL3 and CL2 (@fig-NISP-proportion: C). Fish and birds are both identified from CL5 to CL3; however, their proportions (less than 10%) are much lower compared to mammals. The reptile is represented by one piece of turtle shell found in CL4, which might not be a common food content at the site. Within those identifiable mammals, deer is the major source from CL6 to CL2 that accounts for at least 85% per layer, while CL1 is predominated only by cattle (@fig-NISP-proportion: D). Wild boar was present from CL6 to CL3, and had a higher proportion in CL4 (`r CL4_boar` %), while muntjac appeared in CL5, and was continuously present until CL2. In general, there is an increase in animal diversity in CL4 and CL5, especially in CL4, where boar and fish have slightly higher proportions compared to those in other layers. Given that the taxonomic richness, or animal diversity, could be impacted by sample size varied from layer to layer, the relationship between the number of taxa and sample size (NISP) was examined by linear regression model. The result shows no correlation between the diversity of animals and sample size ($R^2$ = `r div_lm[1]`, P = `r div_lm[2]`), which rules out the potential sample size bias.

@tbl-ubiquity shows deer had been the most frequent animal from CL6 to CL2, with the highest ubiquity in CL4 and CL5 (`r CL4_ubi_deer`), but disappeared in CL1. The second and third frequent animal are boar and muntjac. Although both animals reached their highest ubiquity in CL4 (`r CL4_ubi_boar` for boar, and `r CL4_ubi_munt` for muntjac), their presence patterns are slightly different. Boar was utilized as early as deer in CL6, declined in CL3, and disappeared in CL2, whereas muntjac showed a cultural lag, appearing one phase later than boar. Cattle had a low ubiquity in CL5 and high ubiquity in CL6. Small animals (bird, fish, and turtle) had much lower ubiquity than large animals and they had a slightly increase in ubiquity in CL3. The result of animal ubiquity correspond with the result of their quantity (NISP), suggesting that deer is the most common resource at the site, with an increase utilization of boar and muntjac in CL4. 

Since deer is the most frequent animal at Kiwulan, the frequency of skeletal parts was examined to explore any changes in processing decisions of meat portions between different phases. Deer bones were grouped into six body portions based on their nutritional values [@Madrigal2004], including head (cranium, mandible), axial (vertebrae, sternum, ribs), upper forelimb (scapula, humerus, ulna, and radius), upper hindlimb (femur, tibia, innominate), lower limb (carpals, metacarpals, tarsals, metatarsals, astragalus, calcaneus), and foot (phalanges). The result (@fig-deer-portion: A) shows that the meaty portion, especially the upper forelimb, is the most frequent part from CL6 to CL2, followed by upper hindlimb and the less-meaty portions, lower limb and foot. The consistency of higher numbers of upper limb and lower limb suggests that those elements should be transported together (e.g., @Stiner1991). The genereally low frequency of axial element, such as vertebrae and ribs, might be likely due to a high degree of fragmentation, butchery practices, or dietary preferences. A different pattern between layers is observed in the frequency of cranial bones, for which a few present in CL6, increased to the highest number in CL4, and then decreased thereafter. In addition, lower limb and foot bones appear to be proportionally less in CL2 and CL3 compared to earlier periods. 

Considering the impacted of differential bone density on preservation of skeletal elements, the relationship between the survivorship of deer skeletal elements and bone mineral density was tested by Pearson correlation. The values of bone survivorship were collected from @Lyman1994's research on deer, and calculated by dividing NISP by expected NISP, followed by multiplying 100%. The result (@fig-deer-portion: B) shows that there is no significant positive correlation ($r$ = `r survivor_cor[1]`, P = `r survivor_cor[2]`)) between bone survivorship and bone density, suggesting that density-mediated bias has little impact on the taphonomic processes of deer bones. For the degree of bone fragmentation, CL3 shows higher fragmentation (index = `r frag_CL3_CL4[1]`), while bones in CL4 is less fragmented (index = `r frag_CL3_CL4[2]`). However, the fragmentation rates across all layers are not significantly differed.

Surface modifications, including cut marks, burning damage, and fractures were identified on deer bones from CL6 to CL2, with variations in their proportions (@tbl-deer-modify). Cut marks were present on 50% of bones in CL2, 30% of bones in earlier period (CL6 to CL4), and at a lower proportion of 23% in CL3. Most cut marks were located on major limb joints and long bones, suggesting butchering activities related to disarticulation and meat detaching. @fig-deer-cutmark shows that at least 50 % of joints of each deer part in CL4 present cut marks, with a higher proportion of 75% at the hip. A similar pattern was observed in CL5, but with a lower proportion of cut marks on the ankle, knee, and hip compared to CL4. Not all types of joints were found in CL6, CL3 and CL2, making direct comparisons across all layers difficult. Nevertheless, the overall high proprotion of joints with cut marks suggests intensive proceessing of deer throughout the site's occupation. In addition, cut marks on lower limbs can be associeted with skinning (@fig-cutmark-img: e) and were primarily found on metapodials in CL6 (n = 1), CL5 (n = 4), CL4 (n = 6), CL3 (n = 1), followed by first phalanges in CL4 (n = 1) and CL5 (n = 1). Some joints displayed clean, smooth cut surfaces from chopping (@fig-cutmark-img: a, c), along with narrow V-shaped cut marks observed on most bones, suggesting they were likely made with metal tools [@Greenfield1999]. 

Burned bones (@fig-cutmark-img: d), characterized by charring and color changes, had the highest proportion in CL6 at 40% and gradually decreased to less than 10% after CL4. Bone breakage marks, including spiral fractures, transverse fractures, longitudinal splits, and percurssion scars [@Haynes1983; @Gifford2018; @Fisher1995], were observed frequently on long bones across different layers (@fig-fracture-img). These fractures indicate intentional marrow extraction at Kiwulan. CL2 had the highest proportion of fractured bones (> 50%), compared to 35% in CL3 and CL6, and 25% in CL4 and CL5. Chewing marks were observed on a few bones that show a series of superficial elongated scores and circular depressions (@fig-fracture-img: e)[@Bello2023], suggesting carnivore gnawing. In addition, natural alterations to bones resulting from post-deposition impacts were also observed , such as weathering and root etching [@Gifford2018natural], were identified on approximately one-third of the bones across all layers (@fig-fracture-img: c,d; @tbl-deer-modify).

# Discussion
<!--summary of key results-->
The sampled faunal assemblage from the major residential area at Kiwulan suggests a continuation of sika deer consumption since CL6 until CL2, and then shifted to cattle in CL1. Despite deer had been a substantial part of dietary practices at Kiwulan, variations in their quantity, ubiquity, butchering patterns, and proportions relative to other animals shows changes over time. Based on radiocarbon dates and diagnostic artifacts indicating specific time [@Wang2020ornament; @Chen2007], the cultural layers were further grouped into temporal sequences relative to foreign presences for the following discussion. The sequences include the pre-European period (CL6, CL5), the European period (CL4), post-European period (CL3), and the arrival of Han-Chinese immigrants (CL2, CL1). It should be noted that the European period does not necessary means a solid European colonial control over the Kiwulan, but a broad impacts from European occupation and activities in northern Taiwan, including the involvement into the long-distance trade network, part of the tribute system, and experiences of occasional attacks in cases in Yilan. 

Faunal remains recovered from the layer associated with the European presence reveals the highest quantity, followed by the pre-European period. During the European period, in addition to the predominance of deer, an increased proportion of boar among faunal remains suggests a slightly greater reliance on boar as a secondary meat source compared to other time periods, along with a broader range of medium and small animals, such as muntjac, birds, fish, and reptiles. A similar pattern was observed in the ubiquity of animals, which shows the highest ubiquity of deer, boar and munjact remains during the European period. Interestingly, deer bones from the pre-European period, specifically CL5, presented the same ubiquity as in the European period but in only half the quantity. This might indicate consistency in the frequency and distribution of deer at the settlement scale before and after European presence, but with double the quantity of deer consumed during the European period. During the Chinese period, the low quantity of deer in CL2 and the predominate of cattle in CL1 suggest a sudden shift in dietary practices after the Chinese arrival, indicating a Chinese influence and the decline of indigenous population in this region.

The skeletal part frequencies of deer demonstrate more complete carcasses processed on site during the European period and pre-European period compared to post-European period and Chinese period. The whole carcasses processing and a substantial rise in head parts (eg. crania, mandibles) in the European period align with its high quantity of deer, suggesting more deer were brought back intact to the settlement rather than selectively butchered in the field. On the other hand, the low frequency of head parts in the earliest layer and Chinese period might indicate deer could be processed at hunting location with mostly meaty (eg. upperlimb) and mid-meaty portions (eg. ribs) transported back. Interestingly, front quarters (eg. humeri, radius) are more frequently found compared to forequarters (eg. femur, tibia) among the meaty portions. In addition to culinary preferences or differential processing, a likely explanation for this is that femur and tibia were heavily fragmented due to marrow extraction for their high yields [@Madrigal2002], which could lead to underrepresented resulting from unidentifiable small fragments. 


The cutmarks found on bone portions related to skinning correspond to the description of deerskin as a commodity during the maritime era (Chen, 2004; Cheng, 2017; H√∂llmann, 1991). Interestingly, a similar butchering pattern related to skinning suggests that hides were produced at the same rate during the European period, despite the high demand for deerskin. However, the dramatic decrease in deer bones during the Chinese period may indicate overhunting that persisted for centuries or a decline in the Indigenous population (Zhan, 1995). Moreover, the double increase in pig bones after the European arrival may suggest an increased reliance on pigs. The shape of the third molars of pigs indicates that most were domesticated. This implies that pigs played a more significant role in the diet after Europeans arrived. Eventually, cows replaced pigs during the Chinese period, which might be a Chinese influence.


By contextralizing the sampled faunal remains from the major residential area at Kiwulan   into the time periods with foreign contact, we can observe the

played a consistent role in subsistence strategies.
A taxon can have high NISP but low ubiquity if concentrated in a few contexts (e.g., feasting deposits).
A taxon with high ubiquity but low NISP may have been used frequently but in small amounts.

frequencies of deer bone elements are consistent with the proportion of joints. 
Other than quantity, the measure of presence and absence of a given taxon across the sampeld units could give insights into the frequency and distribution consistency of taxa at a settlement scale.

High-ubiquity taxa (e.g., deer, pigs) likely played a consistent role in subsistence strategies. Low-ubiquity taxa (e.g., rare birds, marine species) may indicate opportunistic hunting, ritual use, or seasonal availability. Changes in ubiquity across layers may reflect environmental shifts or human adaptations. For example, a decline in large mammal ubiquity might suggest deforestation or overhunting, leading to a shift toward smaller prey.

Issue of Taphonomic & Preservation Bias: Some taxa may be less ubiquitous due to poor bone preservation rather than actual scarcity in the past. Small and fragile bones (e.g., fish, rodents) might have low ubiquity due to taphonomic processes.

These post-depositional impacts might have led to an underestimation of cut marks due to the diffculty of surface identification. 

The European maritime cultural exchange to some extent altered the material culture of the Indigenous peoples in northeastern Taiwan by adopting foreign goods or customs into their daily lives. However, a sign of indigenous resilience in the face of European influences and resource exploitation may be seen in the continuing tradition of pottery production and deer consumption with few changes, even though changes were observed through the uneven distribution of prestige items, such as glass beads and porcelains, across different households in the living area and burials (Wang and Marwick, 2020a; 2021).

The continuous practices of ceramic making and deer consumption by the Indigenous peoples before and after the European arrival can be viewed as a way of negotiating their identities and maintaining their traditions. Everyday practices are essential in connecting history and social memories, which helps maintain tradition in a setting of frequent cultural exchange or asymmetrical relations (Silliman, 2009). Moreover, ceramics could be an item that conveys social meaning through its style, such as decorations, and be used to show group identity (Croucher and Wynne-Jones, 2006; Pikirayi, 2007). It is worth noting that the pottery found at Kiwulan, with its typical round body and incised geometric motifs, is also commonly found across many sites during this period in northeastern Taiwan (Taiwan History, 2005). Similar geometric motifs and vessel shapes in the region might suggest the communication of Indigenous identity within the context of ongoing cross-cultural interactions with outsiders, including Europeans and Chinese. Furthermore, despite the availability of foreign items, such as iron pans that could have potentially replaced local pottery for cooking purposes, local ceramics have been used continuously for over 6,000 years (Chen, 2007). This emphasizes the significant role of pottery-making in the lives of Indigenous communities.

By situating the findings within a pericolonial context (Acabado, 2017), locally made pottery and faunal remains reveal cultural persistence and resilience among Indigenous peoples in northeast Taiwan. The interaction between Europeans and Indigenous peoples in the region appears to have been based on negotiation and bartering (Torrence, 2000). For instance, the Dutch reduced and eventually waived annual tribute in 1648 in response to the resistance to paying tribute by most Indigenous settlements in Yilan (BlusseÃÅ and Everts, 2000, pp. 534, 536, 558; Kang, 2012). The continuous consumption of deer and consistent skinning patterns before and after the arrival of Europeans indicate a more adaptable tribute payment system, whereby the Indigenous peoples did not need to hunt more deer to meet European demand. However, it is important to note that there may have been a gradual decline in deer numbers since the post-European period, which is supported by the increased number of pigs found in the same period. This could suggest cultural resilience through dietary changes to adapt to deer overhunting. A more comprehensive investigation across different Indigenous settlements in northeastern Taiwan could provide a clearer understanding of overall dietary patterns.


# Conclusion

Through contextralizing the faunal remains into time periods relaitve to different foreign presences, including the Europeans in the 17th century corresponding to CL4, and the Chinese immigrants since the late 19th century corresponding to CL1, the resutls reveals how indigenous people respond to the foreign influences on their economic aspect. 

Taiwan has played an important role in exploring the effect of colonial activities on Indigenous communities and local environment since the protohistoric period. This project will explore the environmental effect of colonial presence on local ecology on a regional scale using archaeological evidence that has not yet been fully understood. Archaeological materials can offer more direct evidence, allowing better interpretation for the environments where Indigenous live in that can also reduce biases from historical records. Through exploring the long-term dynamics of human-environmental relationship in colonial settings, we can better understand changes in local environments and Indigenous resilience. In addition to the Europeans, the interaction between Chinese traders and Indigenous groups in Taiwan since the Neolithic period, and an influx of Han Chinese immigrants in the 18th century, has contributed to the significant local cultural and environmental transformation. Those historical events are closely related to the Taiwan Indigenous people today, which is crucial to understanding the contemporary Indigenous cultures and socio-ecological landscape. 
The results of this project can advance our knowledge of the reaction of Indigenous people in Taiwan when facing dominant foreign power, and generate new anthropological insights about the adaptation and choices of Indigenous people. In the long term, this research will also benefit local Indigenous people, Kavalan, in northeastern Taiwan and help them to trace back their past and revitalize their cultural heritage by the plans of public presentation in the future. In addition, this project will combine geoarchaeological, geochemical, and computational methods to analyze archaeological evidence. The multidisciplinary approach can not only advance the development and application of scientific techniques in Taiwan archaeology, but also provide an opportunity to form collaborative relationships with scholars with different backgrounds, which will help to develop the academic network and create interdisciplinary collaboration.

This research will contribute to a broader understanding of the diverse ways Indigenous communities adapted to and resisted colonial forces, enhancing our comprehension of the long-term impacts of European colonization on local societies.
