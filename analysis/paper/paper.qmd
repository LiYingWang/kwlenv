  Colonial encounters between Europeans and Indigenous people often led to profound impacts on many Indigenous societies and cultures around the world. In northeastern Taiwan, local Indigenous groups experienced foreign presences through regional trade networks in East Asia, which later expanded into a larger-scale trade network after the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century. This research focuses on local subsistence through faunal remains to understand how Indigenous communities responded to the regional trade activities driven by the European and Han Chinese, particularly the high demand for natural resources, such as deer. By analyzing faunal remains from the upper cultural layer of Kiwulan (AD 1450-1950), a late Iron Age site in northeastern Taiwan, the local participation in deer hide trade and their adaptive strategies were discussed. The results suggest indigenous cultural persistence of deer consumption practiced by local people, along with increased reliance on suids during the European period as the demands for deer products intensified. This paper also provides insights into colonial experiences from Indigenous settlements at the periphery of European territories, a perspective rarely discussed.

# Introduction
<!-- introduction about European expansion -->
European expansion since the 15th century was usually associated with long-distance trade, exploration, and colonization in many parts of the world, which often led to profound impacts on indigenous societies. Depending on particular geographic and historical circumstances, many regions experienced different forms of European colonialism and power relations [@Jordan2009]. Understanding the dynamics of these colonial processes has become a significant issue in archaeology because it provides critical insights into the complex outcomes of European colonization [@Gosden2004]. In Asia, European colonization was mainly motivated by the acquisition of raw materials, natural resources, or luxury items from Asia for commercial purposes [@Prakash1997]. Although the new exchange systems or colonial institutions introduced by Europeans could change local economic systems, social structures, and settlement patterns [@Christie1996; @Junker2004; @Lape2002], indigenous groups did not just accept European colonization passively. Recent discussions on colonial interactions also suggest the active role of indigenous groups in responding to the arrival of Europeans and presenting resistance, negotiation, persistence, resilience, and entanglement [@Torrence2003; @Silliman2005; @Mitchell2010; @Jordan2009; @Alexander1998; @Noe2023]. 

<!-- NE Taiwan as a case study -->
While many studies focus on prominent colonies, places on the periphery of colonial centers were also more and less impacted by European powers or associated trading systems [@Acabado2017; @Trabert2017]. Exploring these areas is important to gain a broader understanding of the varied consequences of colonial expansion. Yilan, located in northeastern Taiwan, is an example of a periphery region where European control was limited and indirect for most of the time but intensively involved in regional trade activities stimulated by the European presence. In the mid-17th century, the VOC (Dutch East India Company) formalized the deerskin trade in Taiwan for export on a large scale, involving many Indigenous communities and Han Chinese settlers [@Heyns2001; @Cheng2017]. Despite some discussions on the operations and policies of the deerskin trade, direct investigations on archaeological evidence into the experiences of local indigenous people with the commercial activities are rare. The European impacts on local ecological conditions have been recorded in many places in colonial settings [@Jordan2009]. Whether the interaction between Indigenous people and their environment changed due to European trade demands requires further archaeological investigation.

<!-- research aim and questions -->
In this paper, I will explore the interactions between people and their environment in a colonial context by examining the resource use of indigenous people through a case study at the Kiwulan site (1350-1950 CE), the largest Iron Age settlement in northeastern Taiwan [@Chen2007]. Kiwulan encountered European colonial power in the 17th century, followed by a large influx of Han Chinese migration in the 19th century. What was the resource use of Indigenous people before and after the foreign presence? Can we identify subsistence strategies in response to impacts resulting from integration into trading network? To address these questions, I will analyze the zooarchaeological assemblages from Kiwulan, because they provide valuable insights into subsistence practices and accommodation within specific social contexts, such as European colonization or being part of the regional trade network [@Defrance2009; @Crabtree1990]. Through a perspective from subsistence, this study aims to shed light on Indigenous persistence and resilience in the face of foreign presence. 

# European Encounters in the Northern Taiwan
<!-- Spanish colonization and the power relations in particular spatial and temporal contexts-->
In 1626, the Spanish East Indies Company (Indias Orientales Espa√±olas) arrived in northern Taiwan and established the San Salvador colony at Heping Dao in Keelung, followed by Santo Domingo in Tamsui, to counter the threat of the VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie; Dutch East India Company) in the Asian market, which had established a colony in southern Taiwan two years earlier [@Borao2009, p.41; @Andrade2007]. Although the Spanish intended to build a colonial city, San Salvador remains its early development during their colonization, primarily consisting of a fortress and a church [@Borao2009, pp. 103-134; @Berrocal2018]. The neighboring area of the fort was inhavited by local indigenous groups, the Taparris and the Quimaurris, who had lived at the location of the fort before being expelled by the Spanish [@Borao2001, SIT:165, p.81]. The relations between the Spanish and indigenous people might not involve extensive colonialism or intercultural domination, and the Spanish territorial control could be limited to the fort. Instead, the Spanish relied on the exchange of local goods and food surpluses with local indigenous people, according to written records [@Borao2001, SIT:170-171]. This corresponds with a higher proportion of indigenous and Chinese items with little European material found in San Salvador [@Berrocal2018], indicating cultural entanglement. 

<!-- the Dutch domination, how and why colonial powers were able to exert control -->
In 1642, the Dutch defeated the Spanish and took over San Salvador and Santo Domingo, expanding their colonial power to northern and eastern Taiwan until 1662. Compared to the Spanish, the Dutch were more strategic in consolidating their power by forming alliances with indigenous villages, implementing political and economic institutions, and conquering villages that were unwilling to comply [@Kang2016; @Andrade2007]. For example, the VOC governors used various colonial institutions to secure their authority, including the annual landdag gathering, taxation, tribute system, village lease system, census investigations, and the selection of indigenous representatives [@Kang2016; @Andrade1997; @Andrade2007]. Among the political institutions, the tribute system operated from 1642 to 1647 and the village lease system introduced in 1644 had great impacts on the local indigenous economy and environment. Based on the tribute system, each household in allied villages was required to pay rice or high-quality deerskin annually. The amount of deerskins collected from indigenous people in northern Taiwan once reached 7,000 pieces in 1646 [@Andrade2007]. Moreover, to increase deerskin exports to Japan, the Dutch implemented a hunting license system (1636-1645) that gave Han Chinese permission to hunt deer on indigenous lands during certain periods [@Heyns2001]. From 1633 to 1661, the average number of deerskins exported from Taiwan was about 67,000 per year [@Koo2011; @Cheng2017]. Those colonial activities accelerated the decline in the deer population and could lead to a harsh situation for the indigenous economy.

<!--variation of colonial powers across regions and indirect colonization at Kavalan-->
Although the Dutch power expanded across nearly all of Taiwan in the middle of the 17th century, the extent of their colonial dominance and control differed greatly among different regions. Colonial rules in regions far from the European forts were usually difficult and unsuccessful. Yilan in northeastern Taiwan is an example of minimal European presence and indirect colonization, with fewer imposed colonial rules for most of the time [@Kang2012]. Yilan is an alluvial plain, located about 70 kilometers from the European colony in Keelung, with mountains in between. The main inhabitants in Yilan were the local indigenous group, the Kavalan. Given its strategic location on the route to Torrobouan, where the Dutch believed gold mines existed, they were eager to bring this area under their control [@DZI2000; @Kang2016, p47]. In 1644, the Dutch invaded Yilan to incorporate the defeated Kavalan villages into their northern colonial territory and demanded tribute from the indigenous people [@Kang2016]. Instead of engaging directly with the Kavalan people, the Europeans relied heavily on the assistance of the Basay people active in northern Taiwan to coordinate and collect tributes in Yilan [@Kang2016]. This indirect approach allowed the maintenance of autonomy and flexibility for the Kavalan people, who were able to negotiate tribute requested by the VOC [@Kang2016]. 

<!-- the pre-existing trade network in norhtern Taiwan-->
Before the arrival of the Europeans in northern Taiwan, an inter-insular trade network had been established since the early 15th century, involving Chinese merchants and indigenous groups in Tamsui and Keelung [@Chen2005]. Chinese traders transported goods such as textiles, porcelains, beads, and metal items to exchange for raw materials from Taiwan, such as gold, sulfur, and animal hides and meats from the local Basay people [@Chen2005; @Andrade2007]. This regional trade network was further connected to maritime trade between Ming China and the Ryukyu Kingdom during the 15th and 16th centuries and later to European long-distance trade in the 17th century [@Chen2005; @Von2019; @Wang2007].Yilan was included in this long-established trade network, where the Kavalan people exchanged products such as rice and deerskins for foreign goods and handicrafts from the Basay people [@Kang2003]. This is evidenced by the large amount of imported foreign goods found across archaeological sites in Yilan, indicating frequent trade activities, especially around the 17th century [@TaiwanHistory2005]. Yilan experienced frequent trading activities driven by the pursuit of foreign goods even before the Europeans arrival, and these activities continued during the European presence in northern Taiwan, likely with some occasional pressure from European powers. This unique historical and spatial context makes Yilan an ideal location to study indigenous reactions to foreign influences and the associated trade networks from a long-term perspective in a pericolonial context [@Acabado2017; @Kang2016, pp. 31-78; @Trabert2017].

# Archaeological Context at Kiwulan
<!--introduction of Kiwulan and the population-->
Kiwulan, located in the northern part of Yilan, is a multi-component site, where the upper component spans from the late Iron Age to the historical periods (AD 1350-1850) [@Chen2007]. As a salvage project, a large scale excavation was conducted at Kiwulan to recover information before it was destroyed. A total of 262 excavation units uncovered abundant artifacts and features, including middens, burials, and post-holes with wooden posts in situ. It suggests that Kiwulan is a well-developed settlement with longhouses (approximately 40 x 80 m) situated side by side and burials located to the north of the residential area [@Chen2004]. The main inhabitants of Kiwulan were the Kavalan people, as indicated by local oral history and the similarities between Kavalan material culture recorded in historical records and archaeological artifacts [@Chen2004]. According to a mid-17th-century Dutch census, there were about 40 indigenous villages with approximately 10,000 people, and Kiwulan (referred to as Kibannoran in Dutch records) was the largest village, with 160 households and 711 people [@Nakamura1938]. In the early 19th century, the population of Kiwulan dramatically decreased to fewer than 100 people due to the population pressure of Han Chinese migrants, which led to the relocation of Kavalan people to eastern Taiwan [@Zhan1995]. 

<!--archaeological materials-->
The most common artifact was locally made pottery with geometric patterns as surface treatments, which was also found at many simultaneous sites in Yilan [@TaiwanHistory2005]. In addition to pottery, a variety of foreign goods, such as porcelains, stonewares, glass beads, carnelian beads, and metal artifacts, were largely found in both the residential area and burials. Due to no evidence of local production of beads or metallurgy, these items are believed to have been acquired through exchange, primarily with the Basay people active in northern Taiwan. This indicates that Kiwulan has continuously participated in regional trade networks closely associated with northern Taiwan since the 15th century and influenced by the long-distance trade during the 17th century [@Wang2007]. Moreover, the use of foreign goods appears to have cultural significance, and previous studies suggested a possible increase in social differentiation due to the introduction of foreign goods [@Wang2020ornament; @Wang2021].

<!--archaeological remains-->
There were a wide range of animal bones and plant remains uncovered, reflecting the diversity of the local diet and the environment close to river and coastal area. The animals include deer, pigs, cows, birds, fish, shellfish, and plants mainly consisting of rice, peach, pandanus, and cucurbits [@Chen2004]. Rice farming seems to be common but limited to a household scale, according to historical records [@]. Shellfish consist of bivalves such as clams and oysters and univalves from rivers and brackish water environments, which indicates a reliance on aquatic and marine resources. Those archaeological remains correspond with tools related to subsistence found at Kiwulan, including iron arrowheads for hunting, iron sickles for crop harvesting, and wooden paddles for water-related activities. According to those pieces of evidence, the subsistence practices at Kiwulan should be primarily reliant on rice farming, supplemented by hunting and fishing for wild resources. The resource use during the periods of external impacts still need further examination to better understands the changes over time. 

# Materials and Methods
To explore changes in dietary practices before and after the European arrival with associated long-distance trade, I examined faunal assemblages from 40 adjacent units at the residential area excavated during the first season (2001-2003) at Kiwulan [@Chen2007]. The remains considered in this study are from dwelling spaces and trash pits that could reflect daily dietary practices, whereas those from burials that might relate to ritual activities are excluded. These 40 units were selected because of their location that were believed to be the center of the settlement with thick archaeological deposits and relatively intact archaeological contexts. Also, the spatial continuity can provides a more consistent framework for understanding food practices over time on a settlement scale. The same excavation and recovery methods applied at the site allow comparison between assemblages from different temporal sequences. 

To construct a reliable fine-grained chronological sequence, archaeological deposits were divided into six cultural layers (CL6-CL1) spanning from the 14th century to the 19th century based on excavation depth, stratigraphic sections, sediment color and texture, radiocarbon dates, and archaeological diagnostic materials that served as time indicators. These diagnostic materials include stoneware commonly found at European associated sites in early 17th-century Southeast Asia, such as Anping jars and martavan [@Sakai2012; @Ketel2011; @Dizon2016; @Hsieh1995; @Lee2021], pipes, and Chinese bricks [@Wang2011; @Hsieh2009]. Although precisely identifying the stratum representing the European arrival is challenging due to its short duration, the separation of strata into six layers based on the criteria mentioned above could offer a relatively robust framework for comparing archaeological records before and after the European influence. Among these six temporal layers, the fourth layer can be associated with the 17th century, when the Europeans occupied northern Taiwan, while the second layer corresponds to the 19th century, associated with the large influx of Chinese migrants in Yilan.

Only the faunal assemblages identified to at least the family level were considered in this study for consistent comparison across time sequences. Deer antlers without attaching to crania were excluded since they were less likely related to dietary practices. To obtain generalized pattern of resource use, measures of ubiquity and taxonomic abundance were applied. Ubiquity measures the frequency of specific taxa through their presence or absence in particular depositional contexts, suggesting the regularity of animal consumption [@Mckechnie2016; @Vanderwarker2010]. Here ubiquity values are expressed as the percentage of units with a given taxon to the total number of units per cultural layers. Faunal assemblages were primarily quantified using the Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) method, with the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) applied when necessary, such as for estimating the expected NISP at a site [@Grayson2004; @Lyman2012]. Different from the minimum number of individuals (MNI) that determines the actual numbers of animals recovered from remains, NISP offers a broad overview of dietary practices by considering all fragmented bone assemblages. Despite the criticism of overestimation the number of animals, NISP captures better variation in species abundance on a site with less impacts from sample size [@Grayson1984; @Lyman2008]. For comparison of identified taxa across classes, the normalized NISP were used to avoid potential biases in identification due to differences in the preservation or recovery of skeletal elements [@Grayson2004]. The normalized NISP is calculated by dividing NISP by the number of skeletal elements. 

Given that deerskin was a primary commodity in local regional exchange since the 14th century and was in high demand during the Dutch colonization period [@Cheng2017], the frequencies of skeletal parts and surface modifications of deer bones were examined to assess butchery and transport strategies. This can shed light on how indigenous people utilize deer in response to high economic demand when involved in regional trade network. Skeletal parts were quantified using NISP and classified into groups based on meat yield and portions: meaty (e.g., upperlimb), mid-meaty (e.g., vertebrae), and less meaty parts (e.g., skull and lower limb) [@Madrigal2004; @Munro2004]. Teeth without associated cranial elements were excluded here to reduce overrepresentation due to their higher preservation and quantities compared to other parts. While lower limbs and skull bones have minimal meat, they are often valued in many cultures for marrow and soft tissues, such as tongue and brain [@Madrigal2002]. Thus, less meaty elements were considered as secondary source of nutrition in the interpretation. Similarly, the degree of fragmentation could also imply the extraction of marrow or grease, which is calculated by dividing the Minimal Number of Elements (MNE) by NISP. Bone surface modifications relative to human butchering and cooking activities, such as cut marks, fracturing, and burning damage, were recorded, as well as natural marks such as weathering and root etching for understanding taphonomic effects. Cut marks on major limb joints, such as shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle [@Lyman2005], were further quantified to explore any changes in butchering patterns between temporal sequences. Moreover, cut marks on lower limbs relative to skinning processes were examined and compared. Those marks are charactersitic of circular and straight incisions left by the series of cuts for acquiring intact animal hides [@Costamagno2019; @Isaakidou2007].

The faunal assemblage analyszed in this paper from Kiwulan is composed of `r total_NISP` bone fragments based on NISP, which increased over time from CL6, peaked at CL4, and then declined dramatically after CL4 (@fig-NISP-proportion: A). A similar trend was also observed in the weight of unidentified small bone fragments (@fig-NISP-proportion: B). Among the faunal remains, the deer family is the majority accounting for about `r deer_fami_NISP_per`% of the bones identified to class level, followed by suid and cattle as the second and third taxon (@tbl-counts). Within the deer family, sika deer is prevalent, with a few bones identified as muntjac and a specimen indicating a possible affiliation with sambar deer. Although sika deer was the major animal source at the site, variations in their quantities and proportions could be observed between temporal sequences across 600 years. To further compare general patterns of dietary practices in terms of their economic values over time, the deer family were separated into two categories based on body size, deer (sika deer, sambar deer, and large deer) and muntjac, while water buffalo and yellow cattle were combined into one category, cattle. Similarly, domestic pig (n = 2, from CL4 and CL6) and wild boar were grouped into the category of suid. Rats (Rattus sp.) were excluded from further analyses as they are normally considered commensal animals, and their relatively intact skeletons from one single archaeological context show no direct evidence of being part of the daily diet.

For animal classes, the relative abundance shows that mammals are the primary dietary source throughout all layers, with fish as the secondary source in CL4 and birds in CL3 and CL2 (@fig-NISP-proportion: C). Fish and birds are both identified from CL5 to CL3; however, their proportions (less than 10%) are much lower compared to mammals. The reptile is represented by one piece of turtle shell found in CL4, which might not be a common food content at the site. Within those identifiable mammals, deer is the major source from CL6 to CL2 that accounts for at least 85% per layer, while CL1 is predominated only by cattle (@fig-NISP-proportion: D). Suid was present from CL6 to CL3, and had a higher proportion in CL4 (`r CL4_boar` %), while muntjac appeared in CL5, and was continuously present until CL2. In general, there is an increase in animal diversity in CL4 and CL5, especially in CL4, where suid and fish have slightly higher proportions compared to those in other layers. Given that the taxonomic richness, or animal diversity, could be impacted by sample size varied from layer to layer, the relationship between the number of taxa and sample size (NISP) was examined by linear regression model. The result shows no correlation between the diversity of animals and sample size ($R^2$ = `r div_lm[1]`, P = `r div_lm[2]`), which rules out the potential sample size bias.

@tbl-ubiquity shows deer had been the most frequent animal from CL6 to CL2, with the highest ubiquity in CL4 and CL5 (`r CL4_ubi_deer`), but disappeared in CL1. The second and third frequent animal are suid and muntjac. Although both animals reached their highest ubiquity in CL4 (`r CL4_ubi_boar` for suid, and `r CL4_ubi_munt` for muntjac), their presence patterns are slightly different. Suid was utilized as early as deer in CL6, declined in CL3, and disappeared in CL2, whereas muntjac showed a cultural lag, appearing one phase later than suid. Cattle had a low ubiquity in CL5 and high ubiquity in CL6. Small animals (bird, fish, and turtle) had much lower ubiquity than large animals and they had a slightly increase in ubiquity in CL3. The result of animal ubiquity correspond with the result of their quantity (NISP), suggesting that deer is the most common resource at the site, with an increase utilization of suid and muntjac in CL4. 

Since deer is the most frequent animal at Kiwulan, the frequency of skeletal parts was examined to explore any changes in processing decisions of meat portions between different phases. Deer bones were grouped into six body portions based on their nutritional values [@Madrigal2004], including head (cranium, mandible), axial (vertebrae, sternum, ribs), upper forelimb (scapula, humerus, ulna, and radius), upper hindlimb (femur, tibia, innominate), lower limb (carpals, metacarpals, tarsals, metatarsals, astragalus, calcaneus), and foot (phalanges). The result (@fig-deer-portion: A) shows that the meaty portion, especially the upper forelimb, is the most frequent part from CL6 to CL2, followed by upper hindlimb and the less-meaty portions, lower limb and foot. The consistency of higher numbers of upper limb and lower limb suggests that those elements should be transported together (e.g., @Stiner1991). The genereally low frequency of axial element, such as vertebrae and ribs, might be likely due to a high degree of fragmentation, butchery practices, or dietary preferences. A different pattern between layers is observed in the frequency of cranial bones, for which a few present in CL6, increased to the highest number in CL4, and then decreased thereafter. In addition, lower limb and foot bones appear to be proportionally less in CL2 and CL3 compared to earlier periods. 

Considering the impacted of differential bone density on preservation of skeletal elements, the relationship between the survivorship of deer skeletal elements and bone mineral density was tested by Pearson correlation. The values of bone survivorship were collected from @Lyman1994's research on deer, and calculated by dividing NISP by expected NISP, followed by multiplying 100%. The result (@fig-deer-portion: B) shows that there is no significant positive correlation ($r$ = `r survivor_cor[1]`, P = `r survivor_cor[2]`)) between bone survivorship and bone density, suggesting that density-mediated bias has little impact on the taphonomic processes of deer bones. For the degree of bone fragmentation, CL3 shows higher fragmentation (index = `r frag_CL3_CL4[1]`), while bones in CL4 is less fragmented (index = `r frag_CL3_CL4[2]`). However, the fragmentation rates are not significantly differed between layers.

Surface modifications, including cut marks, burning damage, and fractures were identified on deer bones from CL6 to CL2, with variations in their proportions (@tbl-deer-modify). Cut marks were present on 50% of bones in CL2, 30% of bones in earlier period (CL6 to CL4), and at a lower proportion of 23% in CL3. Most cut marks were located on major limb joints and long bones, suggesting butchering activities related to disarticulation and meat detaching. @fig-deer-cutmark shows that at least 50 % of joints of each deer part in CL4 present cut marks, with a higher proportion of 75% at the hip. A similar pattern was observed in CL5, but with a lower proportion of cut marks on the ankle, knee, and hip compared to CL4. Not all types of joints were found in CL6, CL3 and CL2, making direct comparisons across all layers difficult. Nevertheless, the overall high proprotion of joints with cut marks suggests intensive proceessing of deer throughout the site's occupation. In addition, cut marks on lower limbs can be associeted with skinning (@fig-cutmark-img: e) and were primarily found on metapodials in CL6 (n = 1), CL5 (n = 4), CL4 (n = 6), CL3 (n = 1), followed by first phalanges in CL4 (n = 1) and CL5 (n = 1). Some joints displayed clean, smooth cut surfaces from chopping (@fig-cutmark-img: a, c), along with narrow V-shaped cut marks observed on most bones, suggesting they were likely made with metal tools [@Greenfield1999]. 

Burned bones (@fig-cutmark-img: d), characterized by charring and color changes, had the highest proportion in CL6 at 40% and gradually decreased to less than 10% after CL4. Bone breakage marks, including spiral fractures, transverse fractures, longitudinal splits, and percurssion scars [@Haynes1983; @Gifford2018; @Fisher1995], were observed frequently on long bones across different layers (@fig-fracture-img). These fractures indicate intentional marrow extraction at Kiwulan. CL2 had the highest proportion of fractured bones (> 50%), compared to 35% in CL3 and CL6, and 25% in CL4 and CL5. Chewing marks were observed on a few bones that show a series of superficial elongated scores and circular depressions (@fig-fracture-img: e)[@Bello2023], suggesting carnivore gnawing. In addition, natural alterations to bones resulting from post-deposition impacts were also observed , such as weathering and root etching [@Gifford2018natural], were identified on approximately one-third of the bones across all layers (@fig-fracture-img: c,d; @tbl-deer-modify). Those post-depositional impacts might have led to an underestimation of cut marks due to the difficulty of surface identification.

# Discussion
<!--results and chronology -->
The sampled faunal assemblage from the major residential area at Kiwulan suggests a continuation of sika deer consumption from CL6 to CL2, and then shifted to cattle in CL1. Despite deer was a substantial part of dietary practices at Kiwulan, variations in their quantity, ubiquity, butchering patterns, and proportions relative to other animals show changes that could reflect the indigenous reactions to foreign presence. Based on radiocarbon dates and diagnostic artifacts indicating specific time [@Wang2020ornament; @Chen2007], the cultural layers were further grouped into temporal sequences in relation to foreign presences for further discussion. The temporal sequences include the pre-European period (CL6, CL5), the European period (CL4), the post-European period (CL3), and the arrival of Han-Chinese immigrants (CL2, CL1). It should be noted that the European period does not necessarily mean a solid European colonial control over Kiwulan, but a broad impact from European occupation in Northern Taiwan and associated colonial economic activities on indigenous people in Yilan, such as getting involved in the long-distance trade network, tribute paying, and suffered from occasional European attacks. 

<!--summary of overall observations across time periods -->
The sampled area at Kiwulan shows a large quantity of faunal remains in the European period, followed by the late pre-European period. Interestingly, deer bones from the late pre-European period presented the same ubiquity as in the European period but in only half the quantity. This might indicate consistency in the frequency and distribution of deer at the settlement scale before and after European presence, but deer utilization was intensified during the European period. During the European period, in addition to the predominance of deer, an increased relative proportion and ubiquity of suid suggests a greater reliance on suid than in other periods. The dramatic decrease in deer bones after the European period might be related to both the decline of the Kiwulan population and a decrease in the wild deer population. Sika deer populations in western Taiwan have significantly shrunk since the 18th century because of habitat loss and overhunting [@Chen2000animal]. An increase in muntjac use may suggest they served as a substitute, replacing the role of suids in earlier periods. Despite this, deer remained a predominant resource for local consumption at Kiwulan during the post-European and early Chinese period. In the late Chinese period, the dietary preference shifts from deer to cattle, suggesting a Chinese influence and the relocation of the Kavalan people to Hualien due to population pressures from Chinese immigration [@Zhan1995]. 

<!--skeletal part frequencies and butchery patterns of deer-->
Although deer was the primary resource at Kiwulan, differences in skeletal completeness across periods suggests changes in butchery locations and cooking practices. There were more complete carcasses in the European and late pre-European period compared to the post-European and Chinese periods. Moreover, the substantial rise in fragmented head parts (cranium and mandible) during the European period indicates greater use of soft tissues, such as brains and tongues, or the transport of more intact deer to the settlement for processing. This aligns with the historical account in 1603, Record of Formosa (Dongfan ji) [@Chen1603], which describes deer tongue consumption and group hunting for deer in western Taiwan. Changes in cooking practices are also evident. The decline in burned bones over time with a lowest percentage in the European period suggests a shift from roasting to other cooking methods, such as boiling. The presence of small chopped bones that could fit in local ceramics at Kiwulan indicates boiling as a possible practice since the European period. The shift in cooking practices suggests that the increased need for deer may have led people to adopt boiling due to its additional benefits, such as maximizing residual meat use, facilitating grease rendering, and improving quality of lean meat [@Lupo1997]. This could be further confirmed through organic residue analysis in the future. 

A consistent pattern was also identified throughout all periods: High frequencies of upper limb bones but low frequencies of vertebrae and ribs, suggesting selectively butchered of meaty portions. Moreover, it is interesting that front quarters (humerus and radius) are much more abundant than hindquarters (femur and tibia). One possible explanation is that femurs and tibiae were heavily fragmented for marrow extraction due to their high yields [@Madrigal2002; @Lupo1998], making them less identifiable in the assemblage. Marrow extraction can be supported by at least 25% of long bones showing fractures and a moderate degree of fragmentation. Another likelihood is that some hindquarters might be traded, as European records mention deer legs and meats as commodities in addition to hides [@Blusse2006, pp.220-224], but without specifying which legs. Considering the overall high proportion of meaty portions at Kiwulan, deer were likely processed not only for local consumption but also for trade. 

<!--deer hides-->
Deer hides trade had prevailed since 15th century in East Asia, and monopolized by the Europeans in the 17th century, when large hides were exported to Japan, especially from western Taiwan [@Cheng2017; @Hollmann1991; @Wang1981]. The cut marks identified on deer lower limbs at Kiwulan confirm the removal of deer skins and likely being traded with external traders. Abundant foreign goods at Kiwulan, including ornaments, porcelains, and metal items, supports frequent exchange between residents and outsiders [@Wang2020ornament; @Chen2007]. This indicates that not only western Taiwan but also northeastern Taiwan was intensively involved and impacted by the long-distance trade. Although lower limbs with skinning cuts did not show a substantial increase in the European period, the disproportionate increase in head parts might hint at a likelihood of brain tanning when preparing hides in addition to tissue consumption. Brain tanning is a traditional way for softening and preserving hides in many Indigenous cultures, such as North America, Southern Africa, North Asia, and Japan [@Baillargeon2010; @Badenhorst2009; @Hatt1969; @Matsumoto2016]. The present-day Bunun group in the central highlands of Taiwan has revived hide tanning based on oral history, primarily using peanuts or pig lard, with a few examples using animal brains [@Li1999, pp. 48; @Xu1994]. Despite the materials for tanning used by the Kavalan people being unknown due to the loss of traditions, brain tanning is a practicable method given the availability of deer heads from hunting. 

<!-- population dynamics and arguments-->
The population dynamics at Kiwulan must be carefully considered when interpreting the faunal results, because high population during the European period inferred by pottery could contribute to the increasing animal use overall [@Wang2020pot; @Hsieh2009]. However, the impacts from foreign presence can be still identified through butchery patterns of deer parts, the relative proportions of animals, and taxon ubiquity. First, deer bones with skinning evidence were mostly found during the European period, followed by the late pre-European phase, corresponding with the rise of regional trade networks since the 15th century and intensified trade in the 17th century. Second, if the high frequency of deer parts during the European period, especially heads relative to brains or tongues consumption, solely resulted from food stress due to population growth, a parallel rise in marrow extraction would be expected. In fact, long bones with fracture patterns were 10-30 % lower during the European period  and the previous phase than in other periods. Third, population growth should have led to a more proportional increase in both large and small animals. Although there was a high taxonomic diversity during the European period, suids present a disproportionate rise in their ubiquity, quantity, and proportion. This indicates that trade of deer products may have driven indigenous people to rely more on suids as an alternative prey, likely due to their comparable body size and meat return rates to deer [@Broughton2011prey]. Suids as a secondary protein source after deer are also observed in prehistoric western Taiwan [@Chuang2021]. This hints the role of suids as a supplement when deer was not sufficient. 

<!--indigenous reaction and resilience-->
Compelling the zooarchaeological evidence and descriptions from historical records, the substantial increase in deer bones in the European period not just simply the result of population growth, but also reflecting intensified hunting driven by deer trade. The results suggest deer is the first priority of food source and commodities at Kiwulan since the late pre-European period and their economic benefits were intensified during the European period. It should be noted that the role of the Dutch is both colonist who demanded tribute from Yilan, and another trader who were incorporated into the pre-existing inter-insular trade network involving Han Chinese merchants and other indigenous groups in Northern Taiwan [e.g., @Torrence2000]. The prestige values embedded in foreign goods in indigenous culture might lead Kiwulan aggrandizers actively participated in the trade rather than resisted [@Wang2020ornament]. After the Dutch left, deer hide trade continued but back to a small scale, with around 10,000 hides exported annually, which is 10 times less than during the European period [@Nakamura1997]. A small deer trade market and low population at Kiwulan might lead to a reduced reliance of suids, as shown by a low proportion of suids in the post-European period and eventually disappeared during the Chinese period.

<!--Final remarks -->
Everyday practices play an essential role for maintaining Indigenous traditions within a colonial setting or frequent cultural exchange [@Silliman2009; e.g., @Noe2023]. The persistence of deer consumption with similar butchery patterns at Kiwulan reflect a maintained tradition, showing community identities. 

while the increased utilization of suids likely responded to the high demand for deer products in large scale trade.  The small sample size after separating them into different periods might limits a further interpretation; however, changes in different phases were still provide evident patterns reflecting changes in animal use. This highlights how Kiwulan residents reacted to foreign presence and demonstrated cultural resilience. 

Deer continued to be consumed until the early Chinese period. 

# Conclusion
By contextualizing zooarchaeological evidence into time periods relative to foreign presence, including the Europeans in the 17th century, and Chinese immigrants from the late 19th century, this study reveals the participation of indigenous groups in regional trade work. The frequencies, butchering patterns, and human modifications on deer bones confirms the active deer hides trade since the early 15th century and intensified during the European period. The results demonstrates even indigenous people in peripheral areas with relatively weak colonial control were also profoundly impacted than previously thought. In pericolonial setting, the continued prioritization of deer consumption at Kiwulan suggests a cultural persistence of food practices, while the strategic reliance on suids during the European period demonstrates adaptation to high demands for deer products, and later incorporating more muntjac in response to overhunting of sika deer. The long-term dynamics of animal use in northeastern Taiwan can enhance our understanding of Indigenous resilience in face of foreign impacts and environmental change. In addition, the role of indigenous people might be more active in the exchange network considering the large amount of foreign goods that were incorporated into local cultures and used as prestige items. A more comprehensive investigation across Indigenous settlements in northeastern Taiwan and including other dietary evidence, such as botanical remains and organic residue analysis in the future could provide a deeper insights into the regional dietary patterns and human-environment dynamics.
